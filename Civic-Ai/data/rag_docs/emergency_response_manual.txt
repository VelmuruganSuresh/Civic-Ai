While the Forestry Department manages general tree health, the clearing of a fallen tree that obstructs a public road or 
poses a direct threat to property is classified as an emergency response.

Complaints detailing a fallen tree are immediately escalated to the Municipal Forestry and Disaster Response Team 
for rapid clearing and road reopening. This team manages all immediate large-scale obstructions caused by environmental incidents.
